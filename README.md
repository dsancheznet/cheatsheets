# cheatsheets

I have collected these cheatsheets over time. Whenever I'm learning a new programming language or software, 
I usually take notes and put it into a cheatsheet. These cheatsheets help me to get into the topic again 
after long periods not working with that software/language. It serves me as a reference to kickstart my memory
